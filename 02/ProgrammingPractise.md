1. Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
    - `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.`
    - `answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.`
    - `answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.`
    - `answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.`

    - Example: 
        - `Input: n = 5`
            - `Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]`

        - `Input: n = 15`
            - `Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz"`

2. Write a program in C# to check for a string if its a palindrome. Check for Inputs - madam, racecar, 1122332211, 11/11/11,  11:11. Check for edge cases if possible. Eg:
    - `isPalindrome(“”) // true`
    - `isPalindrome(1010) // false`
    - `isPalindrome(“taco Cat”) // true`
    - `isPalindrome(“Was it a car or a cat I saw?”) // true`
    - `isPalindrome(“hello”) // false`
    - `isPalindrome(“momma made me eat my m&ms”) //false`

3. Given a number n, print n-th Fibonacci Number. 
- Example
    - `Input  : n = 2`  
        - `Output : 1`
    - `Input  : n = 9`
        - `Output : 34`

4. Given an array and a value, find if there is a triplet in array whose sum is equal to the given value. If there is such a triplet present in array, then print the triplet and return true. Else return false.
- Examples: 
    - `Input: array = {12, 3, 4, 1, 6, 9}, sum = 24;` 
        - `Output: 12, 3, 9`
- `Explanation: There is a triplet (12, 3 and 9) present in the array whose sum is 24.`
