# Features Vs Defects

## Features
- What is Feature Testing?
    - A Software feature can be defined as the changes made in the system to add new functionality or modify the existing functionality. Each feature is said to have a characteristics that is designed to be useful, intuitive and effective.

- Why it is Important?
    - Feature testing is done when any new feature is added to the software or any modification in the existing feature is done. The features added or modified are designed in a way that is useful, interesting, and effective.

    - Testing of the developed or modified feature is very important as any issue found in the existing functionality because the new features can create a lot of problems. It is expected to have this testing done properly, along with the regression testing as and when required.

    - Example: Apple and Samsung keep on adding new features to their products to enhance the quality and to make customers keen to know the new add-on. Customers keep an eye on the new features to be launched, and the attractive and effective features let them buy the same as well.

- How to perform Feature Testing?
    - It can be performed by following pointers.
        - Understand the feature.
        - Focus on potential issues.
        - test scenarios/cases in place for testing.
        - positive/negative test cases to validate the boundary cases.
        - The tester should play around with the new feature and should try all the positive, negative, expected, and unexpected scenarios which a user can perform.

- Additional Details.
    - The feature test is the testing of features just like an actual user. Like how the actual user will use the feature.
    - Users will never find a broken application in case of a feature test as the user can test what they can see and not beyond that.
    - Feature test is an end to end testing and is done when a new feature is added to the software or any existing feature is modified.
    - Feature testing is done by the tester.

- Advantages
    - This testing helps to have the metrics of the feature validate it.
    - Different configurations of the software can be checked.
    - Bugs/issues can be found at an early stage.
    - All the elements of the software can be tested.
    - Various integrations can be checked while doing this testing.
    - Continuous testing and release allow the software to be of good quality.

- Conclusion

    - Feature testing is one of the important aspects of testing and is helpful to release the new features for the applications/software which are already available in the market.

    - It helps the product owner to improve the quality of the product either by modifying the existing feature or by introducing a new feature that is useful and is accepted by the users easily. The organization can face monetary loss as well in case the software does not work as it was intended to. Hence, feature testing is very necessary before the release.

## Defects
    
- What is Defect ?

    - It can be simply defined as a variance between expected and actual. The defect is an error found AFTER the application goes into production. It commonly refers to several   troubles with the software 
      products, with their external behavior or with its internal features. In other words, a Defect is a difference between expected and actual results in the context of testing. It is the deviation of the 
       customer requirement.
- Defect can be categorized into the following:

    - Wrong: When requirements are implemented not in the right way. This defect is a variance from the given specification. It is Wrong!
   
   - Missing: A requirement of the customer that was not fulfilled. This is a variance from the specifications, an indication that a specification was not implemented, or a                requirement of the customer was not noted correctly.
   
   - Extra: A requirement incorporated into the product that was not given by the end customer. This is always a variance from the specification, but maybe an attribute desired         by the user of the product. However, it is considered a defect because itâ€™s a variance from the existing requirements.
    
    - Error: An error is a mistake, misconception, or misunderstanding on the part of a software developer. In the category of the developer, we include software engineers,               programmers, analysts, and testers.
    
- What is Defect Management Process?
    - Defect Management is a systematic process to identify and fix bugs. A defect management cycle contains the following stages 
       - Discovery of Defect
       - Defect Categorization 
       - Fixing of Defect by developers 
       - Verification by Testers
       - Defect Closure 
       - Defect Reports at the end of project
