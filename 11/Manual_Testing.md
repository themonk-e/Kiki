## Manual Testing :
- is the Software Testing Technique that is carried out using the functions and features of an application. In manual testing, a tester carries out tests on the software by following a set of predefined test cases. In this testing, testers make test cases for the codes and test the software and give the final report about that software. Manual testing is time-consuming testing because it is done by humans and there is a chance of human errors.

- Every new application must be manually tested before its testing can be automated. Manual Testing requires more effort rather than automation testing but is necessary to check automation feasibility. There is no requirement of knowledge of any testing tool in manual testing.

## Characteristics of Manual Testing:
- Manual testing is time-consuming.
- High chances of human error in manual testing.
- Possibility of exploratory testing.
- There is no need for programming language in manual testing.
- Manual testing doesn’t use frameworks.
- Less accuracy.
## Steps in Manual Testing:
- Study the software project documentation and guides.
- Study the Application Under Test (AUT).
- Design the test cases that cover all the requirements described in - the documentation.
- Review and baseline the test cases with the team lead and client.
- Execute the test cases on the application under test.
- Report bugs.
- When bugs are fixed, again execute the failing test cases to 
-  verify they pass.

##  Tools used for Manual Testing:
- TestLink
- Bugzilla
- Jira
- LoadRunner
- Apache JMeter
- RedMine
- FogBugz
## Advantages of Manual Testing:
- Fast and accurate visual feedback.
- Less expensive.
- No coding is required.
## Disadvantages of Manual Testing:
- Less reliable.
- Can not be reused.
- Some specific tasks can’t be performed manually.
- The tester needs to know the application well.
- If the project is large then the testing process is time-consuming.
## Types of Manual Testing:
- There are different methods to implement manual testing but it is - broadly classified into three types of manual testing. They are

## Black-Box Testing
- Evaluate the performance and behavior of software from an end user's point of view. The tester only has visibility into the inputs and 
- outputs, not the internal code structure.

## White-Box Testing
- Evaluate the security and functionality of the product in more detail. This testing is performed by a developer or QA professional with 
- an understanding of the internal code behind the software.

## Gray Box testing
- Gray box testing is a combination of white box and Black box testing. It can be performed by a person who knew both coding and testing. 
- And if the single person performs white box, as well as black-box testing for the application, is known as Gray box testing.

## Unit Testing
- Evaluate the performance of individual units of an application to confirm that the functions work as expected. These tests are often 
- performed by developers or QA professionals.

## Integration Testing
- Evaluate an application with two or more components to test how they interact with one another and work to complete a workflow.

## System Testing
- Evaluate the software's performance from end-to-end once all unit and integration tests have been completed. 

## Usability Testing
- Collect first-hand feedback from end users with no prior knowledge of the software on the design, functionality, and ease of 
- use of the product.
