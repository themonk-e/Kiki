# Testing Pyramid
## Pyramid testing is a software testing methodology that emphasizes testing at multiple levels of the application, with each level of testing focusing on different aspects of the application's functionality. 
## It is called "pyramid" testing because it is structured like a pyramid, with the most basic and foundational tests at the bottom and the more complex and comprehensive tests at the top.

## The pyramid testing model is made up of three layers:

- ## `Unit testing`: At the bottom of the pyramid, unit testing involves testing individual units or components of the application code in isolation. Unit tests are typically automated and are used to verify that each unit of code performs as expected.

- ## `Integration testing`: In the middle layer, integration testing involves testing how different units of code work together to ensure that they function as a cohesive whole. Integration tests can be automated or manual, and they may involve testing the interactions between different modules, APIs, or services.

- ## `End-to-end testing`: At the top of the pyramid, end-to-end testing involves testing the application as a whole, from the user interface down to the backend systems. This type of testing can be manual or automated and is typically used to verify that the application meets the user's needs and performs as expected.

## The pyramid testing model is designed to catch issues earlier in the development cycle and reduce the overall cost of testing. By prioritizing unit tests and integration tests, developers can catch issues before they become more costly and time-consuming to fix. End-to-end testing is still important, but it is less efficient for detecting issues at lower levels of the application.

## Pyramid testing is a best practice in software development and is widely used in modern software testing methodologies like Agile and DevOps. It promotes a proactive approach to testing that can help developers build better quality software, faster.
