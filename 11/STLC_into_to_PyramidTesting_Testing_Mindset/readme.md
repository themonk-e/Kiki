# Testing MindSet

A tester's role in an SDlc is includes activities like managing testing processes,  providing timely feedback, progress and status with the team. In addition, the tester also focuses on the process efficiency to deliver quality products in time according to user needs. 

## 1. Think and Act Like a Customer:-
Software testing is all about who, how, what and when to use it. So testers should perform testing in a way that the actual user interacts with that app. Perform end to end user scenarios and think out of the box to find the cases which the end user can perform.
## 2.Preventive Approach:-
Testers should practice preventive measures rather than detective approaches in software testing. As developers started working on the product so testers should focus on user stories. They should understand and clarify the user stories as per customer needs and map them with the working product developed by the developers. So the tester provides quick feedback at the early stage and corrects them where they deviate from the user requirements. This is the first and most important step towards building the right product.


## 3. Continues Testing:-
Testing is the continuous process and testers should perform testing during complete SDLC from start to end. Testing can be smoke, integration, system, regression or test automation. It helps to find the bugs early.
## 4.Root Cause Analysis:
A successful agile tester's work isn't just testing the application. Root cause analysis is the most important step in software testing. The tester must determine the root cause of an error, reproduction steps and possible solutions to this problem may help the developers to fix the issue and it definitely speeds up the development process and ultimately a big time saver of developerâ€™s time.

### What happend? ----> why it happend? ----> Find the root cause

## Steps to do root cause Analysis:

### Define the problem--> identify the root cause--> rootcause corrective action --> root cause preventive action 

## 5.Perform Regression Tests (Automate Tests):-

Agile testers perform regression testing whenever there is any change implemented in the application to make sure that the newly added features will not affect the existing functionality of the software. Testers ensure that the regression testing is a continuous process. Testers can implement automation scripts to robust the regression testing process and reduce the manual testing efforts to get maximum benefits in quick time.

## 6.Participate Proactively:-

Agile testers should proactively participate in sprint groom meetings, daily stand-up, review and retrospective meetings to improve the process and deliver quality product within time and according to user needs.

## 7.Take Ownership:-
Agile testers should be able to take ownership of the testing process within the team and make sure that testing activities run smoothly without compromising the quality. Testers should also ensure that the building product is according to user requirements.
## 8.Self Organized:

Beside technical skills, testers should have good interpersonal skills. He/she should have good knowledge about Agile (Scrum / Kanban etc.). Testers should have good communication skills within the team to achieve the common goal

## 9.Conflict Resolution Champ:-

Testers should have the ability to handle the conflict quickly, effectively and fairly within a team to get maximum productivity. Agile testers should be able to understand the root cause of conflict. He should also be able to understand the personalities and their behaviors to address and find out the way for conflict resolution.

The agile tester is a great asset who thinks diversely and make the agile team stronger with the collaboration and knowledge sharing. Testers engagement within a team helps to balance creative and technical skills that allows the agile team to monitor the progress effectively, efficiently and get maximum results
